/*
A group of students is forming a tech club, and they are 
interviewing K × K students. Each student has two skill levels:
 - Mathematics (M)
 - Physics (P)
These skill levels range from 0 to K-1.

They want to form committees of size N under the following 
conditions:
 - All members of a committee must have different Mathematics 
   skill levels.
 - All members must have different Physics skill levels.
 - For any two students in the committee, the difference of their 
   Math skills must not equal the difference of their Physics skills, 
   i.e., |M1 - M2| != |P1 - P2|

Input Format:
-------------
input1: Integer N – desired committee size
input2: Integer K – number of skill levels for Math and Physics 
(total students = K × K)

Output Fromat:
--------------
An integer representing the number of valid committees of size N 
that can be formed from the K × K students. Return the result 
modulo 10⁹ + 7.

8

Explanation:
------------
Examples of some valid pairs:
(0,0) and (1,2) → |0-1| = 1, |0-2| = 2 ✅
(0,1) and (1,0) → |0-1| = 1, |1-0| = 1 ❌ (same diff → invalid)
(0,0) and (2,1) → |0-2| = 2, |0-1| = 1 ✅

8 Valid Pairs: 1. (0,0) - (1,2)
2. (0,0) - (2,1)
3. (0,1) - (2,0)
4. (0,2) - (1,0)
5. (0,2) - (2,1)
6. (1,0) - (2,2)
7. (1,2) - (0,0)
8. (1,2) - (2,0)
